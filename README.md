Welcome to "The World Simulation," a project where we explore the fundamentals of object-oriented programming (OOP) through the lens of a virtual ecosystem. In this endeavor, I've crafted a C++ program that mirrors the complexities of a living world, complete with animals possessing unique abilities and human navigating through it.

--- Key Features --- 
Object-Oriented Design: This project revolves around the principles of OOP, encapsulating data within objects and enabling interactions through well-defined interfaces.
Virtual Ecosystem: Through meticulous coding, creation of a simulated environment where various entities coexist, interact, and influence each other dynamically.
Abundant Animal Diversity: The simulation boasts a rich array of animals, each with distinct characteristics and abilities. From swift predators to docile herbivores, the ecosystem thrives on diversity.
Special Abilities: Animals are not mere static entities; they possess special abilities that add depth to their interactions. Whether it's camouflage for stealth, agility for swift movement, or strength for dominance, each ability shapes the dynamics of the ecosystem.
Human Interactions: Users can control a human character within the simulation, navigating through the environment using arrow keys. Additionally, a special ability key enables the human to perform unique actions, adding an interactive dimension to the experience.

--- Tasks --- 
Object Modeling: Learn how to represent real-world entities as objects, complete with attributes and behaviors, fostering a deeper understanding of OOP principles.
Inheritance and Polymorphism: Explore the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism as you witness animals inheriting traits and exhibiting diverse behaviors based on their types.
Encapsulation and Modularity: Experience the power of encapsulation and modularity in code organization, promoting reusability and maintainability in complex systems.
User Interaction: Engage with the simulation firsthand, controlling a human character and experiencing the consequences of your actions within the virtual ecosystem.
